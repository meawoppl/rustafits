# Star Detection

Two-stage pipeline: DAOFIND-style matched-filter convolution followed by
proximity-based blend detection. Each detected star carries stamp-based
position angle (theta) and eccentricity for downstream trail rejection.

### Why a Zero-Sum Kernel?

A standard Gaussian kernel responds to both stars and flat backgrounds. Subtracting
the kernel mean makes it a bandpass filter that responds only to point-source-like
features at the expected FWHM scale:

```
Standard:  [0.05  0.12  0.20  0.12  0.05]   responds to constant signal
Zero-sum:  [-0.06  0.01  0.09  0.01  -0.06]  rejects constant, detects peaks
```

### Non-Maximum Suppression via Spatial Hashing

Peaks are sorted by convolution value (brightest first) and inserted into a spatial
grid with cell size equal to the kernel radius. For each candidate peak, only neighboring
grid cells need to be checked for suppression, giving O(n) instead of O(n^2) pairwise
comparisons.

### Peak-Based Deblending

In crowded fields, nearby stars can overlap. When multiple detected peaks fall
within proximity of each other, the pipeline splits the group by nearest-peak
assignment: each pixel in the stamp-based area is assigned to the closest peak
(Voronoi partitioning), and each resulting sub-group is processed independently
for centroid, flux, and area.

Isolated peaks — the vast majority — pass through unchanged, so the
deblending step adds negligible overhead in uncrowded images.

An area guard prevents deblending of extended objects: if the stamp-based
area exceeds `max_star_area`, deblending is skipped and the group is
processed as a whole (and rejected by the area filter). This avoids
Voronoi splitting of large blobs like comet comae, which would otherwise
produce high-flux false detections that displace real stars from the top-N
list.

## Pass-2 Close-Pair Rejection

NMS removes sidelobes, so any close pair that *survives* it is two genuine stars
whose PSFs overlap — and an overlapping companion inside the measurement window
corrupts the fit. Two distinct shapes are rejected on pass 2, because they fail
differently:

1. **Collapsed pair.** A kept peak that suppressed a comparable-strength
   neighbour (`BLEND_CONV_RATIO = 0.25` of its convolution response) now has
   that neighbour's light inside its own measurement window. The fit reads one
   elongated pseudo-star. Tracked at suppression time and rejected.
2. **Fragmented pair.** A slightly wider pair keeps *both* peaks through NMS,
   but their final centroids land inside each other's fitting discs — convolution
   peaks repel past the suppression radius while flux-weighted centroids attract
   (measured: peaks 11 px apart, centroids 6 px). A second sweep over the
   measured centroids rejects any two closer than the fitting disc.

Both use the disc the LM fit actually integrates over, `max(5, 4 sigma)` from
`metrics.rs`, rather than a separate tunable — a companion outside that disc
barely moves the fit. The centroid sweep runs only when calibration produced a
`field_fwhm`.

Scale of the problem on a dense oversampled bench frame: ~31 % of measured stars
had a second significant peak inside their fitting window before this.

## Stamp-Based Position Angle and Eccentricity

After computing the centroid, a stamp region around each star is used to compute
intensity-weighted second-order moments. These give the position angle (theta) and
eccentricity of the blob shape.

### Why Stamps?

Using a continuous stamp region (e.g. 11x11 or larger) over the background-subtracted
image includes many pixels, and the intensity weighting naturally focuses on the
star's true shape rather than threshold boundary geometry. This is especially
important for undersampled stars (FWHM < 3 px), where thresholded regions might
be only 5-15 pixels, causing grid-induced theta coherence.

### Adaptive Stamp Radius

The stamp radius scales with blob area so that larger stars get appropriately sized
moment windows:

```
stamp_r = max(5, floor(2 * sqrt(area / pi)))
```

| Area     | Effective FWHM | stamp_r | Stamp size |
|----------|----------------|---------|------------|
| 10 px    | ~2 px          | 5       | 11 x 11   |
| 50 px    | ~5 px          | 8       | 17 x 17   |
| 100 px   | ~7 px          | 11      | 23 x 23   |
| 200 px   | ~10 px         | 16      | 33 x 33   |

The minimum of 5 ensures undersampled stars still get the standard 11x11 window.
Larger stamps for oversampled stars capture the full PSF wings, giving more accurate
moments.

### Moment Computation

For each pixel (px, py) in the stamp around centroid (cx, cy):

```
v = max(0, data[py, px] - bg[py, px])    intensity weight

sf  += v               total flux
six += v * px          first moment X
siy += v * py          first moment Y
sixx += v * px^2       second moment XX
siyy += v * py^2       second moment YY
sixy += v * px * py    second moment XY
```

Central moments:

```
icx = six / sf        intensity-weighted centroid X
icy = siy / sf        intensity-weighted centroid Y

Mxx = sixx/sf - icx^2     central moment XX (variance along X)
Myy = siyy/sf - icy^2     central moment YY (variance along Y)
Mxy = sixy/sf - icx*icy   central moment XY (covariance)
```

### Position Angle (Theta)

The angle of the major axis of the intensity distribution:

```
theta = 0.5 * atan2(2 * Mxy, Mxx - Myy)
```

Range: [-pi/2, pi/2] radians. Measures the direction of elongation counter-clockwise
from the +X axis.

For round stars theta is dominated by noise — this is expected and handled by the
Rayleigh test's statistical framework (random angles cancel out).

### Eccentricity

From the eigenvalues of the 2x2 moment matrix:

```
trace = Mxx + Myy
det   = Mxx * Myy - Mxy^2
disc  = trace^2 - 4 * det

lambda_1 = (trace + sqrt(disc)) / 2     major axis variance
lambda_2 = (trace - sqrt(disc)) / 2     minor axis variance

eccentricity = sqrt(max(0, 1 - lambda_2 / lambda_1))
```

Values: 0 = perfectly circular, approaching 1 = highly elongated.

### Why I^2-Weighted Centroid?

Standard intensity-weighted centroids (`w = I`) are biased by faint wings and background
noise. Squaring the weights (`w = I^2`) concentrates the centroid estimate on the bright
core, giving more accurate subpixel positions for undersampled stars.

## Adaptive Multi-Level Detection (the plate-solving detector)

Everything above describes the **precise analyzer's** detection. The fast path
(`detect_fast` / `_data` / `_raw`) uses a different detector,
`detect_stars_adaptive` in `analysis/adaptive_detection.rs`, because a single
global threshold behaves badly on exactly the frames a solver most needs: it
either drowns in the diffuse light of a bright nebula or galaxy, or thresholds
that diffuse light itself as one giant blob. Long-focal-length and
extended-object fields under-detect either way.

It deepens adaptively instead:

1. **Falling-threshold ladder with an occupancy mask.** Bright stars are found
   first at a high, star-count-derived level and their `3 * HFD` disks marked
   claimed; progressively lower thresholds then add only fainter, not-yet-claimed
   stars. The deepest pass recomputes background and noise on a 12xN mesh, so a
   faint star sitting *on top of* nebulosity clears a local threshold rather than
   a global one.
2. **Saturation-aware level clip**, `level = max(3.5 sigma, level - bg - 1)`, so
   a flat-topped saturated core still presents supra-threshold pixels and gets
   detected and centroided instead of vanishing.
3. **MAD-annulus local background and a shrink-to-symmetry flux-weighted
   centroid**, with a >=2/4 cross-neighbour hot-pixel gate and `snr > 10`,
   `hfd in (hfd_min, 30]` accept tests — clean centroids on a contaminated or
   gradient background.

Background for the ladder comes from the **histogram mode**, not a mean: a mean
chases the bright extended light of a nebula, the mode does not. Noise is a
3-sigma-clipped RMS about that background.

### The star cap is applied after a full scan

`max_stars` caps the *result*, not the scan. Each ladder level completes its
whole-frame scan before the between-level count check, bounded only by a safety
budget of `max(64 * max_stars, 8192)` detections.

This matters more than it sounds. `scan_region` used to return the moment
`max_stars` detections had accumulated — and the scan is row-major, so on a dense
frame the fast path only ever saw a horizontal stripe of the image: on
`cocoon.fits`, all 500 stars sat above y = 1470 of 4176, a 3 % overlap with the
slow pipeline's top 100. A solver then received a spatially degenerate star set,
and registration fitted a transform on one stripe and extrapolated it across the
whole frame.

### What the fast path reports

`FastStar` carries `x`/`y` (pass-1 intensity-weighted, or PSF-refined under
`with_centroid_refine`), `raw_x`/`raw_y` (always the unrefined pass-1 value),
`peak`, `flux`, and `snr` — the aperture-photometry SNR
`flux / sqrt(flux + pi r^2 sigma^2)`. SNR is what separates a compact source from
extended structure carrying high flux over a large aperture, so a solver can
re-rank its quad pool by it instead of by flux alone, where galaxy and nebula
knots crowd the top.
