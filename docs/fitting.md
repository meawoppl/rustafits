# PSF Fitting (Levenberg-Marquardt)

Non-linear least-squares fitting of 2D Gaussian and Moffat PSF models using the
Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. Used for accurate FWHM and eccentricity measurement.

Two PSF models are available:

| Model | Parameters | Use Case |
|-------|------------|----------|
| **Gaussian** | 7 (B, A, x0, y0, sigma_x, sigma_y, theta) | Fast, good for well-sampled stars |
| **Moffat** (default) | 8 free / 7 fixed-beta | Better wing modeling, reports beta shape parameter |

Moffat fitting is enabled by default. See [Moffat section](#2d-elliptical-moffat-fit) below.

## 2D Elliptical Gaussian Fit (Primary — Used for Stars)

### Model

```
f(x, y) = B + A * exp(-Q(x,y) / 2)
```

where Q is the rotated quadratic form:

```
u = (x - x0) * cos(theta) + (y - y0) * sin(theta)
v = -(x - x0) * sin(theta) + (y - y0) * cos(theta)

Q(x, y) = u^2 / sigma_x^2  +  v^2 / sigma_y^2
```

**7 Parameters:** `[B, A, x0, y0, sigma_x, sigma_y, theta]`

- `B` — background pedestal
- `A` — peak amplitude above background
- `x0, y0` — centroid position
- `sigma_x, sigma_y` — Gaussian widths along major/minor axes
- `theta` — rotation angle of the ellipse

### Levenberg-Marquardt Algorithm

Hybrid between gradient descent (far from minimum) and Gauss-Newton (near minimum).

```
At each iteration k:

  1. Compute residuals:  r_i = observed_i - model_i

  2. Build Jacobian J (n_pixels x n_params):
       J[i][0] = df/dB     = 1
       J[i][1] = df/dA     = exp(-Q/2)
       J[i][2] = df/dx0    = A * exp(-Q/2) * (cos(th)*u/sx^2 - sin(th)*v/sy^2)
       J[i][3] = df/dy0    = A * exp(-Q/2) * (sin(th)*u/sx^2 + cos(th)*v/sy^2)
       J[i][4] = df/dsigx  = A * exp(-Q/2) * u^2 / sx^3
       J[i][5] = df/dsigy  = A * exp(-Q/2) * v^2 / sy^3
       J[i][6] = df/dtheta = A * exp(-Q/2) * u*v * (1/sy^2 - 1/sx^2)

  3. Normal equations:
       H = J^T * J                     (approximate Hessian)
       g = J^T * r                     (gradient)

  4. Damped solve:
       (H + lambda * diag(H)) * delta = g

  5. Trial step:
       params_trial = params + delta

  6. Evaluate gain ratio:
       rho = (cost_old - cost_new) / predicted_decrease

  7. Accept/reject:
       if rho > 0:  accept step, lambda <- lambda / 3
       if rho <= 0: reject step, lambda <- lambda * 2

  8. Check convergence:
       ||delta|| / ||params|| < 1e-6  ->  converged
```

### Linear System Solver

The damped normal equations are solved via **Cholesky decomposition** (the matrix
`H + lambda*diag(H)` is symmetric positive-definite). All arithmetic is in f64 for
numerical stability.

### OSC (Bayer) Input

For OSC (Bayer) images, the analysis pipeline uses green-channel interpolation
to produce a native-resolution mono image. All pixels in the interpolated image
are used for PSF fitting — no green mask filtering. The fitting algorithm
itself is unchanged.

### Validation

The fit result is rejected (returns `None`) if:
- `sigma_x < 0.3` or `sigma_y < 0.3` (sub-pixel — unphysical)
- `A <= 0` (no star detected)
- Fewer than 10 pixel samples (underdetermined)

### FWHM and Eccentricity from Fit

The LM optimizer can converge with sigma_x < sigma_y (the PSF is identical with
swapped axes and theta rotated by π/2). The metrics layer canonicalizes the output
so that **fwhm_x ≥ fwhm_y** and **theta points along the major axis**:

```
if sigma_x >= sigma_y:
    FWHM_x = 2.3548 * sigma_x        (major)
    FWHM_y = 2.3548 * sigma_y        (minor)
    theta  = theta                    (unchanged)
else:
    FWHM_x = 2.3548 * sigma_y        (major — was the y-axis)
    FWHM_y = 2.3548 * sigma_x        (minor — was the x-axis)
    theta  = theta + π/2             (rotated to match new major)

FWHM   = sqrt(FWHM_x * FWHM_y)      (geometric mean, invariant to swap)

eccentricity = sqrt(1 - FWHM_y^2 / FWHM_x^2)
```

The same canonicalization applies to Moffat fits (alpha_x/alpha_y instead of
sigma_x/sigma_y).

## 1D Gaussian Fit (Utility)

**Model:** `f(x) = B + A * exp(-(x - mu)^2 / (2 * sigma^2))`

**Parameters:** `[B, A, mu, sigma]`

Same Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm but with 4 parameters and a 4x4 system solved via
Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting. Used for profile slicing and diagnostics.

### Initial Estimates

```
B0    = (y[0] + y[n-1]) / 2          (average of endpoints)
A0    = max(y) - B0                   (peak above background)
mu0   = argmax(y)                     (peak position)
sigma0 = half-max-width / 2.3548      (from left/right half-maximum crossings)
```

---

## 2D Elliptical Moffat Fit

The Moffat profile models PSF wings more accurately than a Gaussian. Real stellar PSFs
have power-law wings from atmospheric scattering and optical diffraction that a Gaussian
cannot capture. The Moffat function interpolates between Gaussian (beta → ∞) and
Lorentzian (beta = 1) profiles.

Moffat fitting is **always enabled** in the pipeline.

### Model

```
M(x, y) = B + A × (1 + Q(x,y))^(-β)
```

where Q is the rotated quadratic form:

```
u = (x - x0) × cos(θ) + (y - y0) × sin(θ)
v = -(x - x0) × sin(θ) + (y - y0) × cos(θ)

Q(x, y) = (u / α_x)² + (v / α_y)²
```

**8 Parameters (free beta):** `[B, A, x0, y0, alpha_x, alpha_y, theta, beta]`

- `B` — background pedestal
- `A` — peak amplitude above background
- `x0, y0` — centroid position
- `alpha_x, alpha_y` — Moffat scale parameters along major/minor axes
- `theta` — rotation angle of the ellipse
- `beta` — wing slope exponent (higher = steeper = more Gaussian-like)

**7 Parameters (fixed beta):** Same as above but `beta` is held constant during
optimization. The fixed beta value is automatically derived from the calibration
pass (sigma-clipped median of free-beta fits on bright calibration stars). This
removes one degree of freedom, improving FWHM stability when beta and axis ratio
trade off against each other.

### FWHM from Moffat Parameters

```
FWHM = 2α × √(2^(1/β) - 1)
```

This is the analytic half-maximum width of the Moffat profile. For beta → ∞,
the factor `√(2^(1/β) - 1)` approaches `√(ln 2)` and recovers the Gaussian FWHM.

       v
  Moffat2DResult { b, a, x0, y0, alpha_x, alpha_y, theta, beta, converged, fit_residual }
```

### Jacobian (8-parameter, free beta)

```
At each pixel (x, y):

  base = 1 + Q(x,y)
  power = base^(-β)
  dpower/dQ = -β × base^(-β - 1)

  J[0] = 1                        dM/dB
  J[1] = power                    dM/dA
  J[2] = A × dpower/dQ × dQ/dx0  dM/dx0
  J[3] = A × dpower/dQ × dQ/dy0  dM/dy0
  J[4] = A × dpower/dQ × (-2u²/α_x³)    dM/dα_x
  J[5] = A × dpower/dQ × (-2v²/α_y³)    dM/dα_y
  J[6] = A × dpower/dQ × dQ/dθ   dM/dθ
  J[7] = -A × power × ln(base)   dM/dβ
```

For fixed beta (7-parameter): `J[7]` (dM/dβ) is omitted. The Cholesky solver
operates on a 7×7 system instead of 8×8.

### Beta Interpretation

| Beta | Wing Shape | Equivalent |
|------|-----------|------------|
| 1.0 | Very broad wings | Lorentzian |
| 2.0 | Moderate wings | Typical poor seeing |
| 3.0 | Default initial guess | Typical good optics |
| 4.0 | Gentle wings | Well-corrected optics, common fixed value |
| 4.765 | Gaussian-equivalent | Exactly matches Gaussian shape |
| > 6 | Very steep falloff | Near-Gaussian, unusual |

### Validation

The fit result is rejected (returns `None`) if:
- `alpha_x < 0.3` or `alpha_y < 0.3` (sub-pixel — unphysical)
- `A <= 0` (no star detected)
- `beta < 1.0` or `beta > 20.0` (unphysical wing parameter)
- Fewer than 12 pixel samples (underdetermined for 8-parameter system)

### FWHM and Eccentricity from Moffat Fit

The same axis canonicalization as the Gaussian fit applies:

```
if alpha_x >= alpha_y:
    FWHM_x = 2 × alpha_x × √(2^(1/β) - 1)    (major)
    FWHM_y = 2 × alpha_y × √(2^(1/β) - 1)    (minor)
    theta  = theta                              (unchanged)
else:
    FWHM_x = 2 × alpha_y × √(2^(1/β) - 1)    (major — was y-axis)
    FWHM_y = 2 × alpha_x × √(2^(1/β) - 1)    (minor — was x-axis)
    theta  = theta + π/2                        (rotated to match)

FWHM   = √(FWHM_x × FWHM_y)     (geometric mean)

eccentricity = √(1 - FWHM_y² / FWHM_x²)
```

### Fitting Fallback Chain

The pipeline attempts PSF models in order of decreasing accuracy. Each star is
measured by the first method that succeeds:

```
Moffat fit (primary)
  |
  |-- success --> StarMetrics (FreeMoffat or FixedMoffat)
  |
  |-- fail (non-convergence / unphysical params)
  v
Gaussian fit (fallback)
  |
  |-- success --> StarMetrics (Gaussian)
  |
  |-- fail
  v
Windowed moments (last resort)
  --> StarMetrics (Moments) — flagged as lowest accuracy
```

The `FitMethod` enum on each `StarMetrics` records which method produced the result.
Each star also carries a `fit_residual` (normalized LM cost, see [Fit Residual](#fit-residual-quality-metric)) used as a quality weight for frame-level statistics.

| Aspect | Moffat (primary) | Gaussian (fallback) | Moments (last resort) |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|
| Wing accuracy | Accurate power-law wings | Underestimates wings | N/A |
| Parameters | 8 (free) or 7 (fixed beta) | 7 | N/A |
| Min samples | 12 | 10 | 1 |
| Reports beta | Yes | No | No |
| fit_residual | From LM cost | From LM cost | Fixed 1.0 |
| Accuracy | Highest | Good | Lowest |

---

## Two-Pass Calibration

The analysis pipeline uses a two-pass strategy to derive per-field PSF parameters
before measuring all stars.

### Pass 1: Calibration (free-beta Moffat)

1. Detect stars with an initial FWHM estimate.
2. Select up to **100 bright calibration stars** filtered by:
   - Eccentricity < 0.5 (reject elongated/blended sources)
   - Area >= 5 pixels (reject hot pixels and noise spikes)
3. Fit each calibration star with a **free-beta Moffat** (8 parameters).
4. Derive field-wide PSF parameters via **sigma-clipped median** of the
   calibration results:
   - `field_beta` -- the characteristic Moffat beta for the image
   - `field_fwhm` -- used for adaptive screening thresholds and detection kernel refinement

If fewer than 3 calibration stars yield valid beta values, `field_beta` falls
back to a simple median (or `None` if no betas are available), and the pipeline
proceeds without a fixed beta constraint.

### Pass 2: Measurement (fixed-beta Moffat)

1. Re-detect stars with the refined FWHM kernel (if FWHM differs >30%).
2. Measure every detected star using the fallback chain:
   - **Fixed-beta Moffat** (7 params, using `field_beta`) -- primary
   - Gaussian -- fallback
   - Moments -- last resort

When `field_beta` is `None` (calibration did not produce one), pass 2 falls
back to free-beta Moffat as the primary fitter.

### Fit window sizing, and why `field_fwhm` floors it

Every pass-2 path (HFR, moments, Gaussian, Moffat) sizes its window from a
robust per-star sigma, `estimate_sigma_halfmax` — a half-maximum walk out from
the peak. That estimate is then floored at the field value from pass 1:

```
robust_sigma = max(estimate_sigma_halfmax(stamp), field_fwhm / 2.3548)
```

The floor exists because the per-star walk **collapses on broad, low-amplitude
profiles** — a defocused frame is the everyday case. There, the local-background
annulus at r in [4, 8] px sits *inside* the profile rather than outside it, and
the peak reads a single noisy pixel; sigma comes back far too small and shrinks
the LM window to ~5 px. The fit then converges happily on a sub-pixel FWHM with a
low residual, and because the residual is low it carries weight in the weighted
median — so a defocused set reported 0.5-3 px for stars whose true FWHM was
9-16 px.

The field value from bright-star calibration is the reliable lower bound; the
per-star estimate still wins whenever it reads larger, so in-focus frames are
unaffected. With the floor in place, defocused reference sets land within ~5 % of
an external measurement tool.

`field_fwhm` is `None` only when calibration produced nothing, in which case the
raw per-star estimate is used as before.

### Ellipse initialisation: moments confined to the fitting disc

`moments_ellipse` supplies the LM fit's initial axis ratio and angle. It sums
intensity over the stamp, but **only within the circular fitting radius** —
pixels outside it are skipped:

```
if dx*dx + dy*dy > radius_sq { continue }
```

Summing the whole square stamp instead pulled in the corners and any neighbouring
star that happened to sit in them, skewing the initial axis ratio enough to
strand the fit in a rounder local minimum — and a fit that starts round tends to
stay round. Verified per-star against an external reference: on an m42 30 s frame
the matched-set eccentricity delta improves from a median of -0.019 (with a tail
of bright stars reading 0.18 for a true 0.55) to -0.007, and theta RMS from
19.7 deg to 13.8 deg.

### FitMethod Enum

Each `StarMetrics` carries a `FitMethod` value indicating which model produced
the measurement:

| Variant | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `FreeMoffat` | Free-beta Moffat (8 params) -- highest accuracy |
| `FixedMoffat` | Fixed-beta Moffat (7 params) -- field median beta |
| `Gaussian` | Gaussian fallback (7 params) |
| `Moments` | Windowed moments -- lowest accuracy, flagged unreliable |

## Constants

| Parameter           | Value  | Rationale                                     |
|---------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Max iterations      | 50     | Sufficient for well-conditioned star profiles |
| Convergence tol     | 1e-6   | Relative parameter change threshold           |
| Min sigma (Gaussian)| 0.3 px | Below this, fit is unphysical (noise artifact)|
| Min alpha (Moffat)  | 0.3 px | Below this, fit is unphysical (noise artifact)|
| Max beta            | 20.0   | Above this, effectively Gaussian              |
| Min beta            | 1.0    | Below this, unphysical                        |
| Ellipticity trigger | 0.1    | Below this, rotation angle adds no value      |
| Min pixel samples   | 10/12  | Gaussian / Moffat minimum for overdetermined system |
| Arithmetic          | f64    | Avoid float32 precision loss in normal eqns   |

---

## Fit Residual (Quality Metric)

Both LM solvers return an `LmResult { converged: bool, final_cost: f64 }` struct
where `final_cost = Σ(data - model)²` is the sum of squared residuals at convergence.

The fit residual is normalized to be dimensionless and comparable across stars of
different brightness:

```
fit_residual = sqrt(final_cost / n_pixels) / amplitude
```

- `sqrt(final_cost / n_pixels)` = RMS residual per pixel (ADU)
- Dividing by `amplitude` (peak above background) makes the metric scale-invariant

### Typical Values

| Fit quality | fit_residual | Description |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Excellent | < 0.05 | Clean bright star, well-modeled PSF |
| Good | 0.05 – 0.15 | Typical star with some noise |
| Marginal | 0.15 – 0.50 | Faint star or slight model mismatch |
| Moments fallback | 1.0 (fixed) | No fit available — lowest quality weight |

### Use in Statistics

The fit residual is used as a continuous quality weight for frame-level statistics:

```
weight = 1 / (1 + fit_residual)
```

This replaces the binary accept/reject approach with a smooth degradation: well-fit
stars (residual ~ 0) get weight ~ 1.0, poorly-fit stars get proportionally less
influence. Combined with sigma-clipped weighted median, this produces robust
frame-level statistics.
